- Choose your preferred data location.

Upon completing these steps, we'll redirect you to the onboarding page with a default APIKEY automatically generated for you. Use the code example from the [quickstart](https://apitoolkit.io/docs/quickstarts/)and integrate it into your project before you can start using the APIToolkit dashboard.
