## General Questions

### Q1: What is APIToolkit?

**A:** APIToolkit is your comprehensive API development toolbox, offering a wide range of tools for API design, incident investigation, and insights generation. It empowers you to efficiently investigate bugs by analyzing live requests and responses from your server.

### Q2: How do I get started with APIToolkit?

**A:** To get started, sign up for an account on [app.apitoolkit.io](https://app.apitoolkit.io/), generate an API key, and follow our integration guides to incorporate APIToolkit into your project.

### Q3: Is APIToolkit suitable for my project's tech stack?

**A:** APIToolkit is versatile and compatible with a wide range of [programming languages and frameworks](https://apitoolkit.io/docs/quickstarts/). Whether you're using JavaScript, Python, Go, or other languages, you can integrate APIToolkit into your project.

## Integration Questions

### Q4: What programming languages are supported?

**A:** Some services like the API testing does not need any SDK integration. But we have SDKs for multiple languages: Golang, PHP, C#, Java, etc. If we don't support your language or framework, please [drop a message](hello@apitoolkit.io). We can create one on demand quite quickly.

### Q5: How can I integrate APIToolkit with my application?

**A:** We provide comprehensive integration guides for various technologies and frameworks. Check out our [Integration Guides](/docs/quickstarts/) for step-by-step instructions tailored to your specific tech stack.

### Q6: What is the purpose of the APIToolkit dashboard?

**A:** The dashboard is your control center for monitoring and managing your API requests and responses. It provides insights, metrics, and tools for debugging and optimization. It is important to note that the platform is intended to be unusable until you've integrated APIToolkit in an app (ie. you've sent at least one request to APIToolkit).

### Q7: I need assistance with a specific integration scenario not covered in the documentation. What should I do?

**A:** If you encounter a unique integration scenario that is not addressed in our documentation, we recommend reaching out to our [support team](hello@apitoolkit.io) for personalized assistance. Provide detailed information about your specific use case, and we'll work with you to find a solution tailored to your requirements.

### Q8: Will the SDKs slow down my backend?
**A:** It depends. Most SDKs stream data asynchronously via google pubsub streaming, so your requests will see almost zero change in performance. Except if you use PHP. Because PHP doesn't support async workflows by default. But if you have the GRPC extension installed in your PHP environment, the GRPC extension is used by pubsub to stream data asynchronously like in other languages. Otherwise, you pay a very tiny performance hit to send data to google pubsub. But this performance hit is rarely noticable and usually under 5ms added to every request.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Q9: I'm encountering errors during integration. What should I do?

**A:** If you're facing integration errors, consult our [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/troubleshooting-and-faq/troubleshooting-errors/) for detailed steps to diagnose and resolve common integration issues.

### Q10: I'm having difficulties understanding the API documentation. What should I do?

**A:** If you find the API documentation challenging to understand, we recommend taking a step-by-step approach. Start with our [Getting Started](https://apitoolkit.io/docs/getstarted/) guide to build a foundational understanding. If you have specific questions or need clarification on certain topics, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.

### Q11: I'm encountering unexpected responses from the API. How can I troubleshoot this?

**A:** Unexpected API responses can occur for various reasons. Begin by checking the API documentation to ensure you're using the correct endpoints and parameters. Inspect the response headers and payload to identify any anomalies or error messages. If the issue persists, consult our Troubleshooting Guide for further assistance in diagnosing and resolving the problem.

## Security Questions

### Q12: Is my data secure when using APIToolkit?

**A:** Yes, we take security seriously. APIToolkit employs encryption and authentication measures to ensure the security of your data during transmission and storage.

### Q13: How do I report a security concern or vulnerability?

**A:** If you discover a security concern or vulnerability, please reach out to our security team at [security@apitoolkit.io](mailto:hello@apitoolkit.io). We appreciate responsible disclosure and will promptly address any issues.

### Q14: How can I ensure data integrity and consistency when using APIToolkit?

**A:** Data integrity and consistency are essential. To achieve this, implement thorough data validation in your application for both outgoing requests and incoming responses. Validate data types, lengths, and formats to prevent issues caused by improperly formatted data. Our API Integration Guide provides insights into best practices for maintaining data integrity.

### Q15: Do my requests have to leave my server to APIToolkit Servers?
**A:** Only if you want to benefit from the API metrics and the logs explorer. You can also enjoy all the other functionality which don't depend on your API traffic.

### Q16: Can I prevent sending sensitive Data to APIToolkit?
**A:** Yes. All our SDKs support redacting data. Simply specify the json path to the fields which you don't want the SDKs to forward to APIToolkit, and those fields will be stripped out/redacted before the data even leaves your servers. So we would never see them.

## Additional Assistance

### Q17: I have more questions or need further assistance. How can I contact support?

**A:** You can reach our support team by [email](mailto:hello@apitoolkit.io) or through our [live chat](https://calendly.com/tonyalaribe/30min?month=2023-10). We're here to assist you with any inquiries or challenges you may encounter.

### Q18: Are there any community resources for APIToolkit users?

**A:** Yes, we have an active community forum where users can ask questions, share insights, and collaborate. Visit our [Community Forum](https://discord.com/invite/dEB6EjQnKB) to join the discussions.

### Q19: I really love what you're doing. How do I show support?
**A:** Give a shout out on twitter or discord. We would also appreciate honest feedback about what we're building. And suggestions for what functionality you would love to see next.
