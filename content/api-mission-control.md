## Birdâ€™s Eye View of your Entire API

APIToolkit is equipped with the most advanced technology to give you a detailed insight into everything happening around your API. From the list of all your endpoints to metrics, documentation, etc., we have got you covered.

Get a live dashboard monitoring all API activity. Track performance metrics, errors, traffic volumes and more. Configure alerts to pinpoint issues needing attention.

The interactive explorer lets you test endpoints right from the dashboard. See responses with sample payloads. No need to switch contexts to a separate testing tool.

Built-in mocking enables you to simulate API responses. Return static or dynamic mock data with custom status codes, headers, and delays. Great for developing against APIs that are still under construction.

Integrate APIToolkit with your CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and simulation. Run regression tests to prevent introducing breaking changes. Use mocks during development when dependent services are unavailable.

In a nutshell, you get a live and in-depth view of your API. View your endpoints, fields, and even export your API as swagger if you like. The always up-to-date documentation feature is generated automatically from your live traffic.
