The APIToolkit integration guide for AdonisJS provides a streamlined process to
capture incoming traffic data. It collects request information and efficiently
forwards it to the APIToolkit servers.

## APIToolkit Adonisjs integration.

The Adonisjs SDK integration guide for APIToolkit. It monitors incoming traffic,
gathers the requests, and sends the request to the API toolkit servers.

### Installation

Run the following command to install the package from your projects root:

```sh
npm install apitoolkit-adonis
```

### Configure the adonis package using ace

After installing the `apitoolkit-adonis` SDK, run the following command to
configure it in your adonis project

```bash
node ace configure apitoolkit-adonis
```

### Register the middleware

Then add `@ioc:APIToolkit` to your global middlewares list in the
`start/kernel.ts` file

```js
Server.middleware.register([
  () => import("@ioc:Adonis/Core/BodyParser"),
  () => import("@ioc:APIToolkit"),
]);
```

### Configuration

To configure the sdk first create an `apitoolkit.ts` file in the `/conf`
directory and export a `apitoolkitConfig` object with the following properties

- **apiKey**: `required` This API key can be generated from your
  [APIToolkit acount](https://app.apitoolkit.io)
- **redactHeaders**: `optional` This is an array of request and response headers
  that should be omited by APIToolkit
- **redactRequestBody**: `optional` An array of request body keypaths to be
  redacted (i.e should not leave your servers)
- **redactResponseBody**: `optional` An array of reponse body keypaths to be
  redacted
- **serviceVersion**: `optional` A string service version to help you monitor
  different versions of your deployments
- **tags**: `optional` An array of tags to be associated with a request
- **debug**: `optional` A boolean to enable debug mode (ie print debug
  information)
- **disable**: `optional` A boolean to disable the sdk by setting it to `true`

To configure, the default export of `/conf/apitoolkit` should contain all
necessary properties eg:

```js
export const apitoolkitConfig = {
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
};
```

After configuring the sdk, all incoming request will now be send to APIToolkit.

## Redacting Senstive Fields and Headers

While it's possible to mark a field as redacted from the apitoolkit dashboard,
this client also supports redacting at the client side. Client side redacting
means that those fields would never leave your servers at all. So you feel safer
that your sensitive data only stays on your servers.

To mark fields that should be redacted, simply add them to the
`conf/apitoolkit.(js,ts)` default export object. Eg:

```js
export const apitoolkitConfig = {
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  redactHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "Cookies"], // Specified headers will be redacted
  redactRequestBody: ["$.credit-card.cvv", "$.credit-card.name"], // Specified request bodies fields will be redacted
  redactResponseBody: ["$.message.error"], // Specified response body fields will be redacted
};
```

It is important to note that while the `redactHeaders` config field accepts a
list of headers(case insensitive), the `redactRequestBody` and
`redactResponseBody` expect a list of JSONPath strings as arguments.

The choice of JSONPath was selected to allow you have great flexibility in
descibing which fields within your responses are sensitive. Also note that these
list of items to be redacted will be aplied to all endpoint requests and
responses on your server. 

To learn more about jsonpath, please take a look at these resources:
1. [Query expressions for JSONPATH](https://ietf-wg-jsonpath.github.io/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base.html)
2. [JSONPATH Cheet Sheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/JSONPath)
   

## Using apitoolkit to observe an axios based outgoing request

To monitor outgoing request, you need to first enable asyncLocalStorage in your adonisjs project by setting useAsyncLocalStorage to true in your `config/app.ts` file.

```ts
export const http: ServerConfig = {
  useAsyncLocalStorage: true
  // other configs
}
```
After setting asyncLocalStorage to true, simply wrap your axios instance with the APIToolkit observeAxios function.

```typescript
import Route from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route'
import { observeAxios } from "apitoolkit-adonis"
import axios from "axios"

const redactHeadersList = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"];
const redactRequestBodyList = ["$.body.user.name"];
const redactResponseBodyList = undefined;

Route.get('/observer', async () => {
    const response = await observeAxios(axios).get(`${baseURL}/user_list/active`);
    return {hello: "hello world"}
})
```

If you're making requests to endpoints which have variable urlPaths, you should
include a wildcard url of the path, so that apitoolkit groups the endpoints
correctly for you on the dashboard:

```typescript
import { observeAxios } from "apitoolkit-adonis";
import axios from "axios";

Route.get('/observer', async () => {
    const response = await observeAxios(axios, "/users/{user_id}").get(
      `${baseURL}/users/user1234`,
    );
    return {hello: "hello world"}
})
```

There are other optional arguments you could pass on to the observeAxios
function, eg:

```typescript
import Route from "@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route";
import axios from "axios";
import { observeAxios } from "apitoolkit-adonis";

const redactHeadersList = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"];
const redactRequestBodyList = ["$.body.user.password"];
const redactResponseBodyList = undefined;

Route.get("/observer", async () => {
  const response = await observeAxios(
    axios,
    "/users/{user_id}",
    redactHeadersList,
    redactRequestBodyList,
    redactResponseBodyList,
  ).get(`${baseURL}/users/user1234`);
});
```

Note that you can ignore any of these arguments except the first argument which
is the axios instance to observe. For the other arguments, you can either skip
them if at the end, or use undefined as a placeholder.

## Reporting errors to APIToolkit

APIToolkit detects a lot of API issues automatically, but it's also valuable to
report and track errors. This helps you associate more details about the backend
with a given failing request. If you've used sentry, or rollback, or bugsnag,
then you're likely aware of this functionality.

To report errors, you need to first enable asyncLocalStorage in your adonisjs project. 
by setting useAsyncLocalStorage to true in your config/app.ts file.

```ts
export const http: ServerConfig = {
  useAsyncLocalStorage: true
  // other configs
}
```

You can then start reporting errors by calling the apitoolkit `reportError`` function.

```typescript
import Route from "@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route";
import { reportError } from "apitoolkit-adonis";

Route.get("/observer", async () => {
  try {
    throw ("Error occured");
  } catch (error) {
    reportError(error);
  }
  return { hello: "world" };
});
```
